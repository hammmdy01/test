## Description 

**Minishell** is a shell implementation in C that replicates the core functionalities of Bash (Posix version).

The shell interprets user commands, manages environment variables, handles input/output redirections, executes pipelines, and supports logical operators. It provides an interactive interface with command history and proper signal management.

**Key features:**
- Command execution with PATH resolution
- Built-in commands (`echo`, `cd`, `pwd`, `export`, `unset`, `env`, `exit`)
- Input/output redirections (`<`, `>`, `>>`, `<<`)
- Pipelines (`|`) and logical operators (`&&`, `||`)
- Environment variable expansion (`$VAR`, `$?`)
- Signal handling (`Ctrl+C`, `Ctrl+D`, `Ctrl+\`)
- Quote handling (single `'` and double `"`)


## Instructions

### Prerequisites

You need the `readline` library installed on your system.

### Compilation 
```bash
make
```

Launch the shell:

```bash
./minishell
```

Use it like a regular shell. Type `exit` or Ctrl + D to quit.

### Cleaning

```bash
make clean    # Remove object files
make fclean   # Remove all compiled files
make re       # Recompile everything
```

### AI Usage
AI (Claude 4.5 Sonnet) was used as a debugging and learning tool for:

**What AI helped with:**
- Fixing memory leaks detected by Valgrind
- Debugging edge cases in variable expansion and quote handling
- Explaining complex pointer operations and POSIX standards
- Explaining and exemples how does the normal shell lexer/parser works
